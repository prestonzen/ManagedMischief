"The Addiction Life is a series of addictions that chain off each other to get you thorugh it. Realistically we dont care about anything but out minds release sweet drugs to keep ourselves alive. How everyone copes is different but at the basic level it's all the same. Love, drugs, sex, games..it's all the same thing when you look at it from afar. Just addictions that we have but have convinced ourselves that it's all normal and part of life while we honestly have no fucking clue about what we really want or why we are here. I guess all that matters is that we are getting through the endless struggle without suffering completely because of the small addictions that we give to ourselves to get through it. Let us find the addiction to end it all because without that i'm just strung along this stupid journey until I can finally die. But who knows if death ends this chain of addictions.. Life could be just another one of them."
